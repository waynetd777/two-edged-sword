//! "Open at Login", through SMAppService.
//!
//! SMAppService is the same mechanism System Settings > General > Login Items drives, so a
//! toggle here and the switch there are two views of one setting: whatever was set in System
//! Settings is what `status()` reports, and there is no second LaunchAgent to fall out of step
//! with it. (A LaunchAgent plist, which the usual autostart crates write, WOULD be a second
//! source of truth — the app would keep launching from a plist the Login Items list never
//! mentions.)
//!
//! It needs a stable, signed bundle identifier, which this app has: com.wayned.two-edged-sword,
//! signed with the identity in signing.local (see `make install-app`). Registration is per-user and survives
//! a rebuild as long as the identifier does.
//!
//! Nothing here works for the unbundled `make dev` binary: SMAppService registers a BUNDLE, so
//! the menu item is left disabled there (see `available`).
