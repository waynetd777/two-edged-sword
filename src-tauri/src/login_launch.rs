//! Was this process started by the Login Items list, or by someone opening the app?
//!
//! macOS says so in the launch AppleEvent: the `kAEOpenApplication` ('oapp') event that starts
//! every app carries `keyAEPropData` = `keyAELaunchedAsLogInItem` ('lgit') when the launch came
//! from Login Items. Nothing else distinguishes the two — both are launched by launchd, with the
//! same arguments and the same environment — and `SMAppService.mainApp`, which is what this app
//! registers (see login_item.rs), cannot pass arguments of its own.
//!
//! `currentAppleEvent` is only the launch event while AppKit is dispatching it, so this must be
//! asked EARLY. Tauri's `setup` hook is inside that window - verified 2026-09-13 in backup-manager, the
//! same pattern on the same Tauri, by launching the installed bundle through `NSWorkspaceOpenConfiguration.appleEvent` carrying the same flag, and
//! reading true at "setup start" against false for a plain `open -a`. That it is readable at the
//! top of `setup` is what makes this usable at all: the decision lands before anything shows a
//! window, so a login launch never puts one on screen to take away again.
