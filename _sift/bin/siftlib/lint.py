"""`sift lint` - the deterministic backstop for the rules that cannot be undone.

Six checks survive the removal of the pages. Three are hard errors the
pre-commit hook blocks on -- W15 secrets, W16 out-of-repo absolute paths, W19
a tracked file under `local/` or `local/` missing from `.gitignore` -- because
a later commit cannot undo any of them: a pushed secret has to be rotated, a
laptop path is a small leak and useless to a colleague, and a committed
`local/` file is a disclosure about a person that lives in history. W20 warns
on HR and compensation vocabulary, W04 catches a backticked path that does not
exist, and W21 catches two clones that picked the same decision id.

Why any of this remains, when the pages it used to check are gone: the rules
it enforces are the one thing the task eval could show a model does not
reconstruct on its own, and the content it checks is written *by* a model,
across long sessions, under the instruction decay `post_tool` re-injection
exists to slow. Re-injection lowers the odds of the rule being forgotten;
this catches it when it is forgotten anyway.

The ten page checks went with the pages, and four more went with them because
they were not worth their noise: `files.jsonl` hygiene (W09, W13, W18) is
machine-written and cheap when wrong, W14's whole-directory token budget is
meaningless for three files, and W17's one-sentence-per-line is a convention
that does not need a checker. They are in `git show v1-pages:src/siftlib/lint.py`
if the judgement was wrong.

The authoritative hard-fail list is `config.DEFAULTS["lint"]["hard_fail"]`, not
this docstring: an eval run caught a model answering "two" from a stale copy of
these lines rather than from the page, which was right.
