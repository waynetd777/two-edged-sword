"""Bash output governance: condense a flood before it enters the conversation.

The task eval behind this tool found the sift directory's prose changed no outcome and
cost 1.2 to 9.3 times. What it never touched is the other direction: anything
that lands in context is re-sent with every later request, so a single grep
flood is not paid once, it is paid for the rest of the session. That is the
mechanism with numbers behind it, and this module is that mechanism.

The rules here are OpenWolf's (`src/hooks/bash-output-governor.ts` in
cytostack/openwolf), arrived at with production measurement behind them and
followed as a design rather than copied as code -- theirs is AGPL TypeScript,
this is not. What was taken: the token threshold, the family split, which
families may be replaced at all, the 70% abandonment rule, and two refusals
that look like details and are not.

- **Test and build output is never replaced.** A truncated stack trace is
  worse than an expensive one, so those families get a suggestion instead.
- **A pointer must name a file that exists.** A model trusts the pointer and
  stops looking, so when the log could not be written the note says the text
  is gone rather than naming a file that is not there.

Everything in here is pure except `preserve`, so the rules can be tested
without a repo, a hook payload or a session.
