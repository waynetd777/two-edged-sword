"""What an install still needs from a person or an agent, and how to say so.

`sift init` used to end with the repo wired up and nobody told that the wiring
is not the point: a migrated repo can pass every check while holding zero file
descriptions and a 137KB import nothing has read. That is not a health problem
a checker catches, it is unfinished setup, and the only reason it was ever
visible is that somebody happened to look.

So it is computed in one place and said in three: at the end of `init`, in
`doctor`, and once per session to the agent, which is the one that can actually
do the work. Each item disappears from all three the moment it is done.

An available upgrade travels the same three channels and is kept separate from
the setup items on purpose. It is not unfinished setup -- the install is fine,
the world moved -- and it is the one notice here that must not be acted on
without being asked, because `sift update` rewrites the runtime and the
generated blocks in a repo whose owner did not ask for that today.
