"""PostToolUse(any): re-state the rules that must not be forgotten mid-session.

Instruction compliance decays *within* a session - the only structural effect a
factorial study of the question found (arXiv 2605.10039, 1,650 sessions), at
roughly 5.6% lower odds per generated function, with file size showing no
effect. The remedy is therefore cadence rather than shorter rule files: bring
the few rules that matter back, periodically, as short factual statements.

This costs about a hundred tokens each firing and saves none, which is why it
was nearly left out. That was the wrong test. The rules it repeats are the
privacy ones, and they are the only content in this sift directory the eval could show a
model does not reconstruct on its own (`q5`, scoring zero of four without it).
Their failure mode is also the one failure here that cannot be undone: a
committed secret has to be rotated, a laptop path in a shared repo is a small
leak, and a sentence about a colleague published by mistake is a disclosure you
cannot take back. A wasted token is cheap; those are not.

Read from `conventions.md` rather than hardcoded, so a repo that rewrites its
own rules gets its own rules repeated back.
