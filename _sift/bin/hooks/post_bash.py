"""PostToolUse(Bash): govern the output, and track what Bash read.

Two jobs, both about tokens, and neither can be done anywhere else.

**Governance.** Result replacement happens after the command runs: Claude Code
uses `updatedToolOutput`, while Codex uses its documented `continue: false`
and `stopReason` feedback. `PreToolUse` would have to rewrite the *command*,
which can auto-approve a call the user never saw. That is a permission bypass,
not an optimisation. On Claude, the response object is mirrored and only
`stdout` changes; `stderr` is never touched.

**Read tracking.** `pre_read` watches the Read tool, which is not where
duplicate reads happen: OpenWolf measured 140 of 144 of them arriving as
`cat`, `sed`, `head` or `tail` through Bash. Registering those here puts both
channels in one history, so a Bash `cat` followed by a Read of the same file is
caught, and so is the reverse. The write goes through `session.mutate`, under a
lock, because several Bash calls run in parallel and `load`-then-`save` loses
one of them (their issue #83).
